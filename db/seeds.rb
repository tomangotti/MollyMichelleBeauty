# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)
puts "seeding started"
# admin = Admin.create(first_name: "Molly", last_name: "Sestito", email: "test", password: "1234")
# admin = Admin.first
# about = About.create(bio: "Molly Michelle Sestito is a skilled and passionate hair stylist, dedicated to creating beautiful and unique hairstyles that bring out the best in her clients.", admin_id: admin)
